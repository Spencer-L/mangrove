# Setup
## WSL Setup
If you already have Ubuntu 22.04 WSL installed on your machine, you can skip this section.  Otherwise, follow the steps below:
1. **[WSL Ubuntu 22.04]** Currently, Mangrove is tested to work in WSL Ubuntu 22.04.  To install WSL, follow this [official guide]((https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) from Microsoft.
2. **[Updating WSL]** Run `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` in WSL.
3. **[Installing pipx]** Run `sudo apt install pipx` in WSL.
4. **[Installing pdm]** Run `pipx install pdm` in WSL.

## Installing Dependencies
1. Install packages' dependencies for Ubuntu 22.04 - Tested on WSL2.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev pulseaudio portaudio19-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libespeak-dev sox ffmpeg gstreamer-1.0 clang
    ```
2. Install virtual environments manager
   <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/" target="blank">Miniconda</a>.
   
4. Open a powershell terminal window and restart your WSL shell (some packages require a restart to finish installation)
    ```bash
    wsl --shutdown
    ```
5. Clone this repository into your WSL environment and navigate into it
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/estuary-ai/mangrove.git
    cd mangrove
    ```
6. Create a Python 3.9.19 virtual environment with Conda:
    ```bash
    conda create -n mangrove python=3.9.19
    conda activate mangrove
    ```
7. Enter the command `pdm use` and select the correct Python interpreter to use e.g. `/home/username/miniconda3/envs/mangrove/bin/python`
8. Install Python dependencies.
    ```bash
    pdm install -G :all
    ```

Congrats!  This is the end of the initial installation for Mangrove.  Please refer to the next section for running Mangrove for the first time!

## Running Mangrove for the First Time

### Initial Steps
1. Navigate to the Mangrove root directory.
     ```bash
    cd mangrove
     ```
2. Activate the Conda virtual environment that was previously set up.
    ```bash
    conda activate mangrove
    ```
### Selecting an LLM
* ChatGPT: Refer to the [API Keys](https://github.com/estuary-ai/mangrove?tab=readme-ov-file#api-keys) section below for set up if you would like to use OpenAI
    * Flag: `--bot_endpoint openai`      
* Ollama: If you would like to use offline LLMs and have the VRAM to run them, you may consult the [Ollama](https://github.com/estuary-ai/mangrove?tab=readme-ov-file#ollama) section for set up instructions.
    * Flag: `--bot_endpoint ollama`

### Selecting a TTS module
* XTTS: This is a popular offline TTS module that produces both high quality results and is performant at runtime.  You can refer to the [XTTS](https://github.com/estuary-ai/mangrove?tab=readme-ov-file#xtts) section for set up instructions.
    * Flag: `--tts_endpoint xtts`
* gTTS: This is a free cloud-based TTS module offered by Google.
    * Flag: `--tts_endpoint gtts`

 ### Other Configurations
 * You may specify which Port number you would like to use with the `--port` flag.
 * You may use CPU for processing with the `--cpu` flag.

### Example Commands
* Default run command which uses OpenAI and ElevenLabs and port 4000:
  ```bash
  python server.py
  ```
* Example command which uses the above flags:
  ```bash
  python server.py --bot_endpoint ollama --tts_endpoint xtts --port 4000
  ```

## Further Setup as Required

### API Keys
- Mangrove supports the usage of APIs (e.g., OpenAI), which require API keys. Create `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys as follows:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=[your OpenAI API Key]
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=[your ElevenLabs API Key]
    ```

### Ollama
- Install Ollama inside of wsl by running the command:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
- Install an LLM from [Ollama's model library](https://ollama.com/search) e.g.
  ```bash
  ollama run nemotron-mini
  ```

### XTTS
- Running XTTS (using Deepspeed) requires a standlone version of cuda library (the same version as the one used by `torch.version.cuda`):
    1. Install `dkms` package to avoid issues with the installation of the cuda library: `sudo apt-get install dkms`
    2. Install CUDA 12.1 from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=runfile_local).
    3. Follow the instructions given by the installation process including installing the driver.
       ```bash
       sudo sh cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run --silent --driver
       ```
    4. Add the following to the .bashrc file with any code editor ie. `nano ~/.bashrc`
        ```bash
        export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.1/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.1/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
        ```
    5. Add a 6s-30s voice training clip to the root of the project directory.  Make sure to name it `speaker.wav`. 
    6. Make sure to restart WSL afterwards with `wsl --shutdown` in Powershell.

### Networked Configuration

If you are running Mangrove in WSL and would like to configure Local Area Network (LAN) communications for a remote client, WSL must be set to mirrored network configuration.  You can do this with the following steps:

1. Open Powershell and create/open the .wslconfig file in the `C:\Users\[username]\` directory.
2. Add the following to the .wslconfig file:
```bash
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
[experimental] 
dnsTunneling=true
autoProxy=true
hostAddressLoopback=true
```
3. Add an inbound network rule in Windows Security Settings > Firewall & Network Protection > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules > New Rule...
    - Port > TCP, Specific local ports: 4000 > Allow the connection > Check: Domain, Private, Public > Name: Mangrove

#### Tips

- Ensure both Mangrove and the client are connected to the same LAN and both the machine running Mangrove and the LAN allow for device-to-device communications.
- Try restarting after applying the above Network Configurations if they do not initially work 
- [OPTIONAL] You may refer to the Microsoft WSL documentation on Mirrored Networking [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking#mirrored-mode-networking).
